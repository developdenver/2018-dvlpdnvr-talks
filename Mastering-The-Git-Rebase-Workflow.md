# Mastering the Git Rebase Workflow

*Presented by Brooke Kuhlmann*.

## Slides

- [Keynote Presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/bkuhlmann/the-git-rebase-workflow) - This was
  exported in PDF format so some of the animations and movies do not translate well, unfortunately,
  but the content is good. There is a lot to level up on. Enjoy!

## Resources

- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/dotfiles) - Provides additional examples of the various
  Bash aliases and functions I mentioned during the talk.
- [macOS Configuration](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os-config) - These are the automated Bash
  scripts for setting up my development environment. The tooling used in the *Dotfiles* project uses
  this. Might be of interest/help to some.
- [Git Cop](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/git-cop) - Mentioned during the talk for helping
  individuals and/or teams improve their Git Rebase Workflow. Provides a ton of customization
  options. Can be used locally via Git Hooks and/or in your continuous integration builds.
